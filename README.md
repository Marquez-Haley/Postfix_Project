Project Goals:

The goal of this project is to implement data structures. Using a linked based stack to convert arithmetic expressions from infix form to postfix form. Assume that the expression consists of single-digit, nonnegative integers (‘0’ to ‘9’) and the four basic arithmetic operators (‘+’,’-‘,’\*’,’/’). Further assume that the arithmetic expression is input from the keyboard with all the characters separated by white space on one line. Save your program in a file called postfix.cpp.
